This is a simple quiz app, to demo an example usage of React Hooks and Typescript.

To learn more about Typescript, a superset of JavaScript that enables you to turn your JS from weakly typed into strongly typed sytax, go here and start with the documentation: [a link](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Highly recommended.
